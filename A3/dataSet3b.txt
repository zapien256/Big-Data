Marcus Stephan	01/10/2001 12:18 PM	To: Tracee Bersani/HOU/ECT@ECT@EES	cc: Richard A Lammers/SA/Enron@Enron, Rob G Gay/NA/Enron@Enron 		Subject: Re: Letter Credit. - NY Bank Question  		Tracee,		As I told you by phone, I don't believe it is a good idea to talk to 	Petrobr?s about the l/c before delivering it to them because they may require 	a bank's name that we don't have margin to work with right now. Since there 	isn't any limitation on location of the l/c bank on side letter or on the 	fuel contract, we don't have any other options besides Arab Bank and its 	correspondent bank in Brazil. 		If Petrobr?s have any restrictions on the l/c during our meeting or some days 	later (when we will be delivering the l/c), we can argue that there was no 	restriction on location/names of the l/c bank on contract/side letter and ask 	more time to obtain a new one or with another financial institution later.		Rick/Rob - We would like to have your opinion on this. If you believe we 	should consult Petrobr?s prior to deliver the l/c, I can talk to them and get 	their point of view on this issue.

ABN Amro had a local branch in 	Brazil so the $R draws would have been relatively straight forward.  However, 	with Arab Bank's New York Branch, the way a draw would work is this:		-Petrobras sends fax to Arab bank indicating a draw request	-Arab Bank will send funds to Brazil through its Brazilian correspondent bank 	and convert dollars to $R.  There would be an FX trade and fee associated. (I 	assume that Enron would pick up the cost of this.)  		The one issue we need to consider is that any draw request would take 	approximately 24 hours as it involves a correspondent bank and FX trade. 	Please confirm that Petrobras would not have a problem with this. 		Regards,	Tracee				Marcus Stephan@ENRON	01/10/2001 08:34 AM	To: Tracee Bersani@EES	cc:  	Subject: Letter Credit.		Tracee, Hi!		I was talking to a Tozzini lawyer and he said that that language on the side 	letter (" reputable institution") is a kind of standard in Brazil for such 	kind of contracts but that it doesn't have any correlation to any  credit 	rating standard. So, I believe we won't have any problems with the l/c from 	Arab Bank.	I also read the fuel contract and realized that there is no restrictions or 	requirements for the  letter of credit except for its amount.		How is the l/c issuance going?  Will we be able to have it on Friday?		Regards/Marcus.

I would suggest that instead of writing it with no test on gas, just relax 	the requirement to where they have to meet the World Bank Guideline on gas.

Tracee - There is documentation on the KFW hedge as you know.  The only thing 	we could provide on the OPIC loan is a requirement of the lenders to be fixed 	which would be in the CTA if it was required in this instance (or the other 	OPIC documents).  It could be that the only requirement was in the OPIC FOGA 	which originally required us to be fixed within 12 months of funding.  	However, we modified this and now we must select either a Citibank bank loan 	which would be fixed prior to funding by a swap or if we issue bonds they 	will be fixed rate.

The penalties here are calculated as R$ 400 per 	delayed MW per day. 		(2) Penalties due to capacity shortfall (basically - are we able to meet 	dispatch requests). If the moving average of the monthly average of the 	projects equivalent availability, calculated in accordance with provisions of 	annex-7 of the PPA, is less than 92%, a penalty shall be assessed in the 	amount of monthly capacity portion of the tariff for each phase times the 	guaranteed capacity for the phase multiplied by (92% - moving average of the 	monthly availability).		Penalties type (1) does not apply in the concept analyzed as it relates to 	delay in gas (Force Majeure Claim issue). 		Refusing a dispatch request above 220 MW has an impact on penalties type (2) 	(guaranteed capacity is 300 MW). Given that the plant currently has a moving 	average of the monthly availability of about 99.7%, there is a margin built 	up that can be used to accept an availability hit by refusing a dispatch 	request above 220 MW. Therefore, to avoid the huge fuel costs associated with 	being dispatched above 220 MW, the PPA availability penalty concept can be 	utilized as an alternative. If we continue to decline to be dispatched above 	220 MW for a long period however, the built up margin will be reduced and 	eventually we'll have to pay penalties because the 12-month moving average 	moves below 92%.

I think it may also be 	extremely difficult to rework the LD's because the EECC wrap does not match 	up with the subs very well (in some cases EECC's protection exceeds the subs 	and in other is less).  I also wonder who is the credit for contractor 	obligations in this scenario for the lenders?					Peter E Weidler	01/20/2001 09:31 AM	To: Cuiaba Core team, John Guidry/NA/Enron@Enron	cc:  		Subject: Cuiaba EPC/Changeorders - please respond		I would like you all to consider the following concept and send back 	feedback.  Especially John Novak or Eddy - on whether or not we have 	significant exposure with Shell by using this approach. 		If EECC is not neccessarily in the "for profit" business and Enron's goal is 	to conclude the construction with as least cost as possible.  We need to 	eliminate the negotiations between EECC and the project.  Right now - we get 	change orders from EECC which include a markup of 10 %, and are "fluffed up" 	because they know the project is going to object and negotiate and Shell is 	not going to be happy until we reduce the cost of the proposed change orders 	- this is a waste of time but has become part of the continuous 	contractor/prjoect dance.   EECC also has some profit within the turnkey 	portion of the job (pipelines and powerplant)  and is also asking for early 	completion bonus on some things.  My concept is for Cuiaba team and EECC to 	go complete open book.  Let us analyze and categorize all of EECC's actual 	costs so we understand where we stand currently with respect to work 	performed under the turnkey and outside of turnkey - and then we go straight 	to final negotiations with Conduto and Bolinter.  EECC and us will both 	jointly negotiate best deal possible, using our combined knowledge.   Get the 	debate on EECC profit and whether or not it was appropriate to commission 	certain work, or whether or not it was their fault or our fault, out of the 	picture so everyone can focus on minimizing the total cost of this project - 	from Enron's perspective.		We we conclude the process = the project gets charged all direct costs and 	third party costs.  For those items which is clearly not the responsibility 	fo the project - we offset those against profit and present the results to 	Shell. We go to Shell and say here it is - please audit and either approve or 	object.   Whatever the dispute - we will negotiate and as a result $10mm 	profit may get decreased.		The advantage of this route is - we work together to minimize overall cost of 	project, we eliminate an intercompany debate which will cost time and money 	and Enron can undertand what the cost of this thing really is.  Right now I 	do not actually know how much of the capex is profit and could and should be 	deducted from our capex budget number as it relates to Enron's position in 	the project.		Downside is - Shell may consider that Project management has violated its 	fudiciary responsibility to the project  Although I think this can be 	mitigated by audit and prior explanation of what we are doing to Shell.  I do 	not really want Shell directly involved until we are done - because I do not 	know what we will find or conclude.  Need help on fine tuning this part of 	the strategy.		Let me know if I have rocks in my head.  If this is a good idea - I would 	like to run it to ground this week with EECC.		Pete

I just decided to add Yale to my list in order 	to get more chance. Would you mind to write me another recommendation letter? 	Yale asks you to describe specific activities or accomplishments which can 	demonstrate my strength and weakness in a separate page in addition to the 	ranking. I think this will demand more of your time to give some examples. I 	can think of the examples for you if you need. 		I would appreciate if you can take more time to write me this last 	recommendation letter.		Maggie

This should solve the warranty issue with the banks 	because it covers defects, design, and workmanship on the turbines and 	includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, for insurance purposes the 	turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new technology designation. 			Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 	supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 	insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 	ended then the insurer will pay.			Now we just need to come up with a fix for the drop dead date.		Regards,			Rob

KFW is ok on relying solely on the back-up fuel supply support but OPIC is 	not there yet.		Also, KFW is offering to allow us to go back to floating on interest rate. 	They will provide the cost within the next 24 hours, but they have indicated 	that it will be significantly less than US$250,000 for a current estimated 	annual savings of 60 bps.

The changes which the lenders should review are as follows:		EOT Claim Agreement		14 Day Availability Test with respect to Provisional Completion Phase III on 	oil, on a look-back basis over 6 months, required as a specific performance 	requirement	After PC on oil, Siemens can demobilize	Compensation for commissioning on oil $5,720,000; $30,000 per day for owner 	delay	Bonus of $15,000 per day that PC achieved before 17 Feb	Phase III Substantial Completion on gas	60 days prior written notice on gas availability	If sound level guarantees demonstrated on oil, only need to demonstrate far 	field sound on gas	Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on 	oil; if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 	commissioning obligations	Performance guarantees remain in tact per EPC	Long stop date on Phase III Substantial Completion on gas of 31 Dec 01	Substantial Completion on gas - punchlist limited to deficiencies from Work 	performed to achieve Substantial Completion on gas	Risk of Loss remains with owner during commisioning on gas	Siemens agrees to enter into negotiations to provide operational assistance	Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during 	commissioning	Compensation for commissioning on natural gas $1,220,000 lump sum; $20,000 	per day for owner delay	Warranty - 6 months after Provisional Completion on oil	Option to buy extended warranty for up to 6 months at $175,000; must elect 60 	days prior to expiration of Primary Warranty Period	Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven 	by owner	Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas	Payments to be paid (including EOTof $5,720,000): 15 Feb  $5,446,141; 28 Feb  	$14,353,401 with offset of $4,000,000 for Phase I LD payment due from Siemens 	to SCC	Late payment interest rate of 14%		TAA Agreement		Effective date Provisional Completion Phase III on oil	No 12 month look back	12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas 	commissioning unless owner delay. 			Additional Insurance		In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if there 	are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated that we 	will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business interruption 	insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve the issue over 	the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects, design, and 	workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, 	for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new 	technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18 months per event 	with US$150,000 deductible.	Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 	supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 	insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 	ended then the insurer is the primary.			We will need to execute these agreements immediately.  Please advise with 	your thoughts as soon as possible..

For avoidance of doubt, the text of both versions are included in the letter.	He said that our understanding was correct and that he would answer in the 	affirmative.	He was not familiar with the original text. I showed him my copy with the 	three initials. He asked whose initials were from Furnas. (I don't know - was 	not present at that meeting. Rick  and John may know).	Roberto de la Nina gave him the background from Furnas side.	Tariff and Commissioning. 	Celso started the session by drawing a diagram of the Contractual Obligation 	provisions compared to the Current Situation. He wanted to lead us  to pay 	the fuel differential, from 100% dispatch or alternatively buy from the MAE 	(lower cost to us).  	[Comment.- Irrespective of  the Force Majeure arguments that we have, the MAE 	make up possibility has to be used carefully to avoid  falling into the trap, 	by precedent, or assuming a market exposure that we presently do not have.]	I replied that his reading of the Contract was correct, except that he did 	not read the Force Majeure section.  We had the obligation to change to gas 	on the dates he mentioned, except that we have a Force Majeure due to the 	Government Actions, and therefore we have the right to change the schedule.	Celso replied that his people did not think this fit the case; i.e. 	"additional difficulty of drilling through rocks"; I replied that we have a 	strong case that everyone  knows about, including the regulator Aneel, which 	extended the use of the CCC until June 2001.	[Comment.- I expect Furnas to challenge our documentation to calculate how 	many days we are entitled due to FM causes. At the end there will be a 	"negotiated agreement", or the result or arbitration.]	Aneel Authorization.-  I told him that we needed to bring him up to date 	about Aneel's approval.	 Aneel sent us a letter that we were not authorized to operate in Combined 	Cycle, not that we had CCC account coverage during for CC operation.	Gave him a copy of the letter of our request to Aneel asking for both ; CC 	and CCC coverage. We were ready for 480 MW, but on diesel.	Celso asked what we would do if we got CC authorization but not CCC 	coverage.- I told him that we did not have the money to pay for the fuel, 	that we would have to convert back to Simple Cycle, use the current 	authorization for minimum use and wait  for the gas to be available to go 	through commissioning.	He said that under the contract we are obligated to provide power; that he 	would buy from the MAE and sent us the bill. I told him that under the 	Contract we can change the gas-change-over date because of FM. During a FM 	period our mutual obligations would cease, except that they in this case they 	had a capacity payment obligation given that the cause was Government 	action.  	He understood that they have a right to cancel the Contract after 12 months 	[Comment - but they would have the MAE exposure as well for the Initial 	Contracts]	Laine gave him an update of the ridge contruction and the parallel path that 	we will take on Ridge 10; drill and also seek a permit for a partial crossing 	of the first crest, drilling through the second crest, all withing the 	existing ROW.	Laine explained the processes and limitatios of returnind to SC operations 	and then back again to CC gas comissioning.		Our Proposal.-  Our proposal is that we get authorization to enter into 	operation as combined cycle unit; the CCC administration pays for the diesel, 	and receives the gas revenues as compensation. This keeps us and Furnas at 	the Contract equilibrium, and the Brazilian electric system has 480 MW 	combined cycle plant; providing stability to that area.	Under this proposal, until the gas gets there to start commissioning, ONS 	would dispatch the power plant according to economic dispatch at R$110/Mwhr; 	minimum 290 MW. The CCC covers the actual dispatch the MRE cover the dispatch 	to the Initial Contracts with Furnas.	I suggested that they join us for that petition to Aneel. He called Mario 	Santos to set up a meeting, to enlist the help of ONS in that petition as 	well.	The meeting is set up for Wednesday at 9:30 AM.   To prepare we need to 	provide the factual information, heat rates, costs, etc.

I have been working with Celso Bernardi, Rafael Rangel	and Rick Hopkinson of Enron and Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of Machado	Meyer on this. Also, I am preparing sort of a "critical path" items	checklist on the sub-debt that John Barquin and I are going to discuss with	John Novak tomorrow at 9 a.m. After we work through it, I would be glad to	forward it to you.		In short and in answer to your specific question, as advised by Machado	Meyer, I think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all	of the sub-debt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements	between EPE and GasMat (as Borrowers) and then the respective Enron and	Shell lenders to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2001 as the note	from Celso below explains. Then we will just deliver request for extension	letters to the Central Bank to request them to amend the registrations to	reflect the new maturity date. This should all be done before the existing	loans mature on December 31, 2000.		Please let me know if you have any further questions for now and I will keep	you apprised of any developments.

Can I go forward with this extension of the	sub-debt until June 30, 2001?		-----Original Message-----	From: Beckworth, Melissa	Sent: Tuesday, November 21, 2000 7:20 PM	To: Novak, John (Enron); Barquin, John	Cc: 'miguel.mendoza@enron.com'	Subject: FW: Cuiaba sub-debt	Importance: High			John/John -		We have a new sub-debt issue -- The existing shareholder subordinated loan	promissory notes have a maturity of the earlier of December 31, 2000 or the	closing of third-party financing, and the Central Bank registrations	reflect	that. Celso has requested MMSO to draft letters to the Central Bank asking	for an extension of the maturity to June 30, 2001. He says that Johannes	Walzebuck has agreed to the extension of maturity for Shell but that he has	had no response from Enron (I think he sent a message to Novak, Powell,	Lammers, Rangel, Walzebuck and Dutton on Nov 13). The A&R SFA doesn't have	an explicit maturity date for the loans but it has a form of note attached	which carries the maturity date -- the notes are to be considered a part of	the agreement. The form of note attached to the A&R SFA carries default	interest but the simple form notes that are actually in existence (the ones	that were just printed) do not have default interest provisions (we had to	match the original registrations and default interest was not a registered	payment condition). Unless you all want to just leave the notes and hope	that we can collect default interest, I have asked MMSO what we need to do	-- I assume we have to issue replacement promissory notes with the new	maturity date. We would then send the notification letters to the Central	Bank notifying them of the extension. We also need to address this in the	2nd A to the A&R SFA. My note below tries to explain what all is going on	with the various assignments and notifications.		The main thing I need from you is to let me know what your thoughts are	from	an Enron perspective and how you wish for me to proceed. Do you need to	talk	to Lammers/Powell/Gay? Let me know.

I do not recall receiving a message from you about this previously, and I	have been out of the office without access to my e-mail or international	service all day today. The Amended and Restated Shareholders Funding	Agreement will have to be amended (there is a 2nd Amendment in draft form	right now that has not been finalized) to include a new form of note with	the new maturity date. We will also have to draft some form of letter	agreement/waiver to address the fact that the maturity of the previously	issued promissory notes is being extended (perhaps this can just be an	additional provision in the 2nd amendment).		Fabio and Irenne - Will we need to issue replacement promissory notes with	the new maturity date for all of the existing promissory notes or is there	any other way to address this effectively under Brazilian law?		Also, Fabio and Irenne - with respect to the notification letters for the	TR	Buyout loans, I wonder if it might be easier to go ahead and deliver the	notices of assignment to the Central Bank because the loans that were	assigned (and the loans mentioned in the letters) do not encompass all of	the shareholder loans. The Shell assignment agreement for the SGL to SCHL	assignment for EPE should be complete within the next few days and is dated	"as of September 30, 2000". I assume Shell has notification letters to	deliver as well for that assignment. Did you receive my fax with the	mark-up	of the notification letters?		Maybe we could do this in two steps:		1) Deliver the notification of assignment letters and schedules for the	Transredes Buyout and for the Shell assignment of EPE loans from SGL to	STDCL.		2) Execute 2nd Amendment to A& R Shareholders Funding Agreement with new	form of promissory note with new maturity and approving extension of	maturity date of existing loans, complete the Enron assignments of the	replacement notes (for EPE and GasMat credits) to Enron Netherlands	Holdings	B.V., and notify the Central Bank of the extension of the maturity date on	the existing promissory notes and of the Enron assignments.		The reason I suggest this breakdown is that the items in number 1 are	basically complete and have been approved. The others are not complete yet	and could be done in the next week or two.		I know this is a lot to coordinate; you can let me know if you have	suggestions about the different steps we should take and in what order.		I will try to speak to John and John about the Enron approvals on this and	get back to everyone.

Irene has told me that the change in the dates of the certificates is due	to	the fact that the loans that are going to be used to repay the amounts	reflected in the certificates are not going to be granted this year, but	only mid next year. Therefore, the current date (12/31/2000) would be	changed to June 30th, 2001. Celso, I would like to ask you to kindly	confirm	this understanding, since Irene has told me that you asked her to make the	letters to the Central Bank notifying the date change, but she had not had	more details about the matter.		Finally, Melissa has asked Machado Meyer whether the current drafts of the	letters to the Central Bank notifying the two assignment of credits (from	Transredes to Enron and Shell, so called "Transredes Byout", and from Shell	Generating to Shell Treasury) have to change due to the date change	reflected in the new letters circulated below.

As to the lender 	Veto, the Veto should only apply to the banks covered by their umbrella and 	should not be applicable to the relationship to other MLA's or uncovered 	lenders.  For instance if OPIC is lending $50MM, FMO $10MM, and the B banks 	$40MM, the voting rights should be 50% for OPIC and 50% FMO (since FMO is the 	lender of record for the B banks).

Following are comments and questions regarding	certain negotiated points:		EOT Claim Agreement		Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;	if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 	commissioning	obligations		We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner	to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is	introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the	owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.		Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas		We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the	Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 	coverage	intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).	Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 	coverage	if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor	action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have	this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.		Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during	commissioning		During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to	test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of	curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.	We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the	benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently	review the basis for the curves.		Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by	owner		Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.		Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas		During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand	down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil	firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is	not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.	Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated	point.		TAA Agreement		No 12-month look back.		We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 	into	the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an	extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 	of	dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated	point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 	availability	will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are	concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if	maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not	being dispatched.		12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas	commissioning unless owner delay.		We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 	the	initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it	takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to	Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 	performance	testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.		In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if	there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated	that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business	interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve	the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,	design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.	Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which	is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18	months per event with US$150,000 deductible.		Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 	this	point.		Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.		Regards,		Bradley

Can divide the presentation up into - 		getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 	Laine 	Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 	YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick	MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose	Current economics. - Rick		Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 	on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 	send the page per topic around by this friday.  		I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.		Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 	Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.		Pete

Following are comments and questions regarding	certain negotiated points:		EOT Claim Agreement		Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;	if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 	commissioning	obligations		We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner	to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is	introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the	owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.		Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas		We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the	Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 	coverage	intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).	Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 	coverage	if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor	action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have	this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.		Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during	commissioning		During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to	test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of	curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.	We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the	benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently	review the basis for the curves.		Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by	owner		Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.		Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas		During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand	down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil	firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is	not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.	Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated	point.		TAA Agreement		No 12-month look back.		We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 	into	the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an	extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 	of	dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated	point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 	availability	will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are	concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if	maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not	being dispatched.		12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas	commissioning unless owner delay.		We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 	the	initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it	takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to	Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 	performance	testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.		In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if	there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated	that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business	interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve	the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,	design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.	Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which	is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18	months per event with US$150,000 deductible.		Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 	this	point.		Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.		Regards,		Bradley

Please advise.		Regards,		Rob					Bradley.Barta@swec.com on 02/14/2001 09:43:16 AM	To: Rob.G.Gay@enron.com	cc: susan.garven@stoneweb.com, frank.kluesener@kfw.de, Bboeh@opic.gov 		Subject: Questions re: Siemens Negotiations					Rob - We've reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your	negotiations with Siemens.  Following are comments and questions regarding	certain negotiated points:		EOT Claim Agreement		Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;	if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 	commissioning	obligations		We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner	to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is	introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the	owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.		Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas		We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the	Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 	coverage	intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).	Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 	coverage	if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor	action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have	this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.		Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during	commissioning		During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to	test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of	curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.	We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the	benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently	review the basis for the curves.		Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by	owner		Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.		Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas		During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand	down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil	firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is	not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.	Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated	point.		TAA Agreement		No 12-month look back.		We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 	into	the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an	extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 	of	dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated	point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 	availability	will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are	concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if	maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not	being dispatched.		12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas	commissioning unless owner delay.		We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 	the	initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it	takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to	Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 	performance	testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.		In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if	there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated	that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business	interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve	the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,	design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.	Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which	is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18	months per event with US$150,000 deductible.		Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 	this	point.		Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.		Regards,		Bradley

Also, do we really want the Banks to say it is not fruitful to proceed with 	the consent?  Would it be better for the Banks simply to stick to their guns 	re the consent, decline all of YPF's suggested changes, and insist on their 	version of December 2000.  That way, YPF could be portrayed as partly to 	blame for failure to achieve a financial close by May 4, 2001.

Given the current status of things, it would seem to me that there	is no value in proceeding with the consent.  On the other hand, we need to	continue to build our case in the event of an arbitration with YPF.  It	would seem to me that the best thing would be for the lenders to tell Doris	that the lenders'  understanding is that, under the current project	schedule, the conditions precedent under the YPF GSA cannot be satisfied,	and that Enron and YPF have had some discussions regarding this issue and	will continue to discuss the issue.  Until the YPF GSA is restructured in	some form, there is little value in proceeding on the consent, especially	given that YPF and the lenders are still so far apart on the consent.		The status of the YPF consent is as follows: Doris sent a revised draft of	the consent to the lenders in August 2000.  The lenders responded with	comments (which included several of my comments) in October 2000.  Doris	then responded with a counter-draft in December 2000.  Doris' latest draft	again had numerous, significant comments, which I have not thoroughly	reviewed.  A quick review, however, indicates that Doris has cut in half	many of the time periods for the lenders to cure SCG defaults.  In addition,	Doris has restructured several provisions in order to make certain YPF	commitments run in favor of SCG only and not the lenders, which may be of no	value to the lenders in a situation in which the lenders have to step into	SCG's shoes.  I am confident that the lenders will not accept Doris's	comments, since many are proposals the lenders have rejected before.		Let me know whether I should suggest to Dave Schumacher a response to Doris	along the lines I recommend.

I'm slated to begin work on	the Monday the 18th, and must say I am VERY excited to get started.  It will	be an honor to work for Enron.  I know I am just beginning a long and	productive career with an amazing company.		I received your email address from Molly Magee.  I had a few questions	regarding Holiday plans and start-day preparation and she directed me to	this email address.  I know you are very busy, so please reply at your	convenience.		My first question regards holiday planning.  If I remember correctly, it was	mentioned someone was working or on call one weekend a month.  It may be too	early to tell, but if I'm scheduled to work that weekend (December 22nd -	25th) I would like to make plans accordingly.  My mother in Missouri can be	very persistent (aka annoying) and wants to know my plans.		Also, I would like to put my name first on volunteers to work that weekend.	However, I understand my lack of experience may prevent me from accepting	that responsibility this soon.  If I will not be working, may I ask that you	tell me what days I will have off.  I need to know if I should buy a plane	ticket, get my car serviced for the drive, or make plans in Houston.		Finally, I've bought a training video covering Excel and begun reading a	book titled "Trading Natural Gas", by Fletcher J. Sturm (former senior	trader of natural gas derivatives for Enron Capital and Trade).  I want to	start contributing from day one and would like to know if there is anything	I can do to facilitate that.  Any other programs, books, push-up and	crunches, you could suggest would be aggressively pursued.		I look forward to seeing you again next week Mr. Gay.  My schedule on Monday	appears to be; "New Hire Training" from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  If possible, I	can be on your floor early to observe, leave for training from 8 to 4, then	return at 4:10 pm and stay until the close of business if you like?		Thank you.		Respectfully,				Daniel D.

Do you have any comments?			I've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution in	the southwestern portion of the US.  Summarized below is their collective	response:		     1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the Federal	Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over the	interstate sale and distribution of natural gas.  The Department of	Transportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resulting	from the gas explosion.	     2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area -- currently it is	at $  17.11__ for 30-day _Jan'01__.  The reason prices are high is due to the	excessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.  Thus,	gas is flowing into California -- the only way gas will flow east away from	California is in response to higher prices.	     3.   Enron is not "holding back supplies to the area".  Enron is not a	producer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does not	have or utilize storage capacity in this area.  Also, Enron controls	pipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day	-- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).	The dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketing	subsidiary of El Paso Gas.  Moreover, there are numerous marketers of	natural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility and	liquidity.  Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence the	price of physical suppliles in the area.	     4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,	winter) periods, not annual periods.  And, the winter season for which	marketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (not	on December 1 as the note below suggests).	     5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies to	the area.  Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in the	buying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gas	supplies.  Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,	making margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron would	be disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold back	physical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying and	selling of positions in natural gas.										"Lowe, Carol" <CPLowe@NationalGypsum.com> on 11/30/2000 04:46:56 PM		To:   "Richard D. Rathvon (E-mail)" <Richard.D.Rathvon@enron.com>	cc:   "Kellie Metcalf (E-mail)" <kellie_metcalf@enron.net>		Subject:  West Coast Gas			Rich,		The following information was included in an email that was sent to our	executives and CEO.  The tone leaves a negative impression for Enron.  Can	you or someone at Enron comment on Enron's role or lack thereof with	respect	to this item?  I am afraid this will taint our plans if not addressed	quickly.  I want to circulate Enron's side of the story.		Carol			Excerpt from email circulated today:		Due to the lingering effects of the August gas pipeline explosion in New	Mexico that killed 10 people, coupled with some possible market	manipulation	by Enron, we're facing a potential problem at Phoenix in the short term and	possibly all three western plants longer term.  The pipeline which is owned	by El Paso Gas is back in operation, but is being limited to 50% of	capacity.  Weather has turned cold, spiking demand for gas in the region.	Enron appears to be holding back supplies to the area until at least	December 1st, when many of its contracts set the index price for the	following year.  Consequently, gas prices on the spot market in Arizona are	hitting $25 per MMBTU.  The situation has caused several marketers to	declare force majeure.  If our marketer does so, we'll be curtailed.  As	you	probably know, we don't have any backup fuel capabilities at these three	plants.  The U.S. Dept of Transportation controls this and is reported to	be	getting involved.  Will keep you posted as it unfolds.

We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's 	transport to be close to $1 million/ month.		2.  I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her 	here.  If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El 	Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our 	customers.  The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.		3.  The spreads out West have been huge this summer.  We were able to take 	advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very 	difficult time.		4.  When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding 	down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on 	management duties.  		5.  Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day 	off.  She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several 	different jobs at a time.		6.  The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.  I would estimate 	that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million 	to the desk.

Role included helping evaluate lead 	arranger proposals and term sheets, selecting lead arrangers and participants 	and participating in road shows representing Enron sponsorship.  Successfully 	raised $300MM during a very challenging time in Argentina as well as a very 	difficult time for the U.S. capital markets (i.e., Eurobond completed 	immediately following the largest single drop in history of the NASDAQ).  		2) TRANSREDES:		a) $10MM Liquidity Facility:  Lead approval and documentation effort for 	$10MM Enron-provided credit facility to provide liquidity for oil spill clean 	up expenditures and  Cuiaba construction cash calls.  Prepared DASH, managed 	approval process wtih RAC and TRSA management, and lead documentation to 	closure.  Loan was successfully repaid with proceeds from the Cuiaba buy-out 	transaction.  Credit facility allowed TRSA to avoid a severe liquidity crisis 	which could have stopped the clean up process and put its concession from the 	Bolivian government at risk.		b) Buy-out of TRSA's interests in the Cuiaba Project:  Selected for lead role 	in Enron's buy out of 50% of TRSA's interest in the Cuiaba Project for $40MM 	(Enron's share).  Prepared DASH and ESA risk committee and Enron Corp. board 	presentations, worked with RAC to obtain approval for transaction and 	coordinated legal documentation process with counsel (internal and external) 	and partners (Shell as co-buyer, TRSA as seller).  		Buy-out transaction restored much needed liquidity to TRSA's balance sheet 	and permitted Enron and Shell to move ahead on the Cuiaba financing without 	having to guarantee TRSA's pro-rata share of contingent sponsor support 	required by the Cuiaba lenders.  Restored liquidity to TRSA will permit it to 	meet its working capital needs until May 2001 when its new tariffs become 	effective (post Transition period).		c) Cuiaba Contingent Sponsor Support: In coordination with TRSA/Cuiaba 	buy-out effort, assisted Cuiaba team in obtaining approval of contingent 	sponsor support for OPIC/KfW financing.  Prepared DASH and worked with RAC to 	obtain internal approval and assisted in preparing ESA risk committee and 	Enron Corp. board presentations.  Contingent support package along with 	buy-out transaction was approved by Enron's board. 		c) Financial Advisory Assignment:		Selected by TRSA and ESA management to work with TRSA in a financial advisory 	capacity, to advise and assist in the arrangement of up to $700MM in new 	third party debt over the next 4 years to finance TRSA capital expansion 	program.  In exchange for such services ESA began receiving a $12,500/month 	retainer fee (October 2000 - May 2001 = $100,000 of fee income) plus the 	reimbursement of all out-of-pocket expenses.  		Roadshow with U.S. Exim, Bolivian pension funds, local banks and 	international banks with local presence and CAF now completed.  Assisting 	TRSA management with resolution of Supreme Decree and Tariff Reset and 	existing debt seniority issue.		GTB:		a) Financial Advisory Assignment:  Selected by GTB and ESA management to work 	with GTB in a financial advisory capacity, to advise and assist in the 	arrangement of up to $210MM in new third party debt over the next 4 years to 	finance GTB's capital expansion program.  In exchange for such services, ESA 	began receiving a $12,500/month retainer fee (October 2000 - May 2001 = 	$100,000 of fee income) plus the reimbursement of all out-of-pocket 	expenses.  		Roadshow with U.S. Exim, Bolivian pension funds, local banks and 	international banks with local presence and CAF now completed.  Letter of 	Interest obtained from U.S. Exim.  Working with GTB management to finalize 	credit rating process and clean up commercial contracts for financing. 		TRAINING:  Completed Executive Impact training course (requirement for 2000).		In the event you did not receive the amount of manager/peer feedback that you 	would like to see to prepare my review, I do have the feedback booklet that I 	got recently from the Executive Impact course that you could use.  I have it 	in my office...I can have Blanca get it for you if you want to see it.		Thanks for your support.		BRS

First of all, I would like to say that all of the schedulers are performing 	at a high level, except for Hillary and Jan.  We have formally addressed 	Hillary's performance problems, and he is on  a schedule for improvement or 	he is out.  We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, 	and next week intend to formalize that also.  That Jan makes more than anyone 	else in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we 	are not getting a return on that investment.		The rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already 	aware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc.  	In Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end 	of the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable 	with her job performance.  Also, I intend to help smooth over other 	inequities through the bonus pool.		In regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service 	during the rough time we've had when we were understaffed.  Bob Superty has 	supported this, and the information you provided him this last week should 	help in that endeavour.  Patti has had her pay increased this year after a 	salary survey was performed by our HR group.  I would like to point out that 	Patti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level.  Also, Patti 	would move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager.  I am not sure 	what the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go.  I 	would like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes 	on, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you 	and Mike still want to do.  		As regards to the new hires:  yes, we can hire more like these at these 	prices.  We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, 	especially at these prices.  Patti did an excellent job hiring these 	individuals.  We have already started the process of looking for more like 	these to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan.  We also need to hire more 	for establishing a bigger physical presence in the west.  We probably need to 	sit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for 	expanding the desk.  		Finally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver 	office do all nominations for IM Denver deals.  This has met stiff resistance 	in the past, and I do not know how ya'll feel about it, but I promised that I 	would bring it up. I personally feel that Denver and CIG would be isolated 	from us if the operations were to move to Denver.  		If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.  Thanks.

I also 	would like to be able to use the bonus system this year to reward some of the 	people who have been here the last couple of years.  It seems like we have to 	keep paying outside people more and we don't get to reward the experienced 	people who stick with us enough.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

The following also need to be included in the draft:		1.  provisions for sponsor guarantee buyout, once agreed; and		2.  a provision along the lines of Section 7.06 of the TBS Security	Agreement (relating to step-in to the TBS agreements) so as to give	SOTL/Enron Corp privity in relation to these rights.  (This point was agreed	with Mary some time ago in one of the New York meetings.)		Consideration also needs to be given as to whether there should be express	recognition of the rights of STDC and Enron Netherlands to subscribe subdebt	under the ECA.

The format isn't exactly pretty, but 	you'll be able to figure it out: 	? 		The Real Debate 		Jim Lehrer:???? Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice 	President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on 	these rules:? I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question 	and deliver rehearsed remarks 	designed to appeal to undecided women voters. 	The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten 	senior citizens into voting for him. 	When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly while he 	continues 	to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes. 		Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name 	of 	a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that 	strains the bounds of common sense? 		Gore:??????????? As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly 	made???????????? love the way we have so often during the 30 years of 	our 	rock-solid marriage, the downtrodden have a clear choice in this 	election. 	My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans. 		I, on the other hand, want to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad 	lock box so they can't hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who 	is 	here tonight. Mrs. Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs, 	one 	by one, to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and 	personify problems for me. 		Also, her poodle has arthritis. 		Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush, your rebuttal. 		Bush:???? Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, 	crying with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity 	exists.? I want to empower those crying people to make their own 	decisions, 	unlike my opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush. 		Lehrer:??? Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan 	Milosevic 	were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able 	to 	pronounce his name? 		Bush:??????? The current administration had eight years to deal with 	that 	guy and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do 	about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick 	would present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then 	Dick 	would tell me which one to choose. 		You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough foreign policy 	decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New Mexico. 		Lehrer:??? Mr. Gore, your rebuttal. 		Gore:??????? Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly 	interested 	in. I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of 	poison gas in World War I.? I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian 	War. 	And when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper 	in 	a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. 		If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal 	knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an 	iron clad lock box. 		Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them 	with 	simple metaphors. 		Lehrer:??? Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security 	system? 		Gore:??????? It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I 	have 	proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to 	every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a 	single 	penny until the year 2250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion 	over 	the next 10 years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs 	delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who 	will 	also help them with the child-proof cap. 		Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush? 		Bush:??????? That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I 	have to do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide 	whether 	I'm going to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds 	to 	reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds. 		Lehrer:??? It's time for closing statements. 		Gore:??????? I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, 	but 	I will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning 	the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me. 		Bush:??????? It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by 	electing no one but Republicans. 		Lehrer:??? Good night. 	? 	?

Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting 	today. . .		Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell 	or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract 	Exchange module?  Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough 	information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would?  		In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual 	"re-entry" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange?  OR is 	there additional information that you need to create the path that is not 	sitting in Contract Exchange?		This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in 	Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY.		It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us 	your input!		Thanks,	Carrie

However, I think it is apparent that they have an 	increasing anxiety level on a variety of fronts which I am sure is being 	conveyed to the lenders and could significantly impact their willingness to 	fund.  Did you get the same impresion Laine?

Below find comments/notes -		Brad mentioned his concern about turnover of O&M staff with Duane's 	departure.   Responded that we had a capable plant manager with 10 years 	plant experience plus key people at the lower levels had remained.  Also told 	Brad that the two I&C consultants we have had since the outset of the project 	are still working at the facility and that we were taking on 6 technicans 	from Siemens during combined cycle start-up.  Brad seemed okay with the 	response.		Discussed two key contractual issues -	TAA - They expressed the importance of keeping the TAA in place with no 	dilution since it is so important to the lenders.  Furthermore they mentioned 	that SCC's position is Siemens will come after us to dilute the TAA and that 	in fact it is no longer valid.  (I agree Siemens will come after us for the 	risk profile modification) Responded that we felt that the TAA was still 	valid and mentioned that Siemens might want the TAA to commence at completion 	on oil.  Sue's commented that we need to calculate how much it would cost us 	to keep the start date at Substantial Completion on fuel.	Phase II - Explained that given the current commissioning program that we had 	no intention of lowering the dampners and testing for simple cycle Phase II 	on gas.  They are on board with this concept.  We just need to get a white 	paper to them to explain in detail.		Drilling -	The comment was the formations are tough but will get there slowly but surely.	Using 1 May as gas available at the plant date.		Change Orders -	Transmitted SCCs frustration on little movement on change orders related to 	the pipeline.  Told them that many of the change orders still without 	documents and in any case the strategy was to settle up at the end of the job.	Brad and Sue mentioned that they would feel more comfortable with the process 	and putting a number on the value of the change orders if we were closer to 	resolution.	worried about the size of the change orders - especially the outside case.	have not given this to the banks	there outside change order case is as follows -		    Power Plant  Pipeline  Total		Total EPC         US$ 419 mm	Approved Change Orders                    22 mm	Pending Change Orders  US$  10 mm  US$ 25 mm               35 mm	Cont Change Orders                8 mm            24 mm               32 mm		Hope this information is useful.		rgds		Laine

I talked to 	Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users 	perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to 	how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over 	different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We 	can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.		I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did 	not want to forget them.  		1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how 	will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.  		2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes 	at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.		3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it 	would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.  		I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure 	there are a lot of others.		Thanks.

The headings will	be lined up when Trish adds the art and ads.  A calendar, also, which is in	the next e-mail.		I'll appreciate your comments by the end of tomorrow, Monday.		There are open issues which I sure hope get resolved before printing:		1.  I'm waiting for a reply from Mike Bass regarding tenses on the Home Depot	article.  Don't know if there's one developer or more and what the name(s)	is/are.		2.  Didn't hear back from Ted Weir regarding minutes for July's water board	meeting.  I think there are 2 meetings minutes missed, 6/22 and July.		3.  Waiting to hear back from Cheryl Hanks about the 7/6 City Council and 6/7	BOA meetings minutes.		4.  Don't know the name of the folks who were honored with Yard of the Month.	 They're at 509 Narcissus.		I'm not feeling very good about the missing parts but need to move on	schedule!  I'm also looking for a good dictionary to check the spellings of	ettouffe, tree-house and orneryness.  (Makes me feel kind of ornery, come to	think about it!)		Please let me know if you have revisions.  Hope your week is starting out	well.			'Nita		 - AUGUST.WPD

Below find comments/notes -		Brad mentioned his concern about turnover of O&M staff with Duane's 	departure.   Responded that we had a capable plant manager with 10 years 	plant experience plus key people at the lower levels had remained.  Also told 	Brad that the two I&C consultants we have had since the outset of the project 	are still working at the facility and that we were taking on 6 technicans 	from Siemens during combined cycle start-up.  Brad seemed okay with the 	response.		Discussed two key contractual issues -	TAA - They expressed the importance of keeping the TAA in place with no 	dilution since it is so important to the lenders.  Furthermore they mentioned 	that SCC's position is Siemens will come after us to dilute the TAA and that 	in fact it is no longer valid.  (I agree Siemens will come after us for the 	risk profile modification) Responded that we felt that the TAA was still 	valid and mentioned that Siemens might want the TAA to commence at completion 	on oil.  Sue's commented that we need to calculate how much it would cost us 	to keep the start date at Substantial Completion on fuel.	Phase II - Explained that given the current commissioning program that we had 	no intention of lowering the dampners and testing for simple cycle Phase II 	on gas.  They are on board with this concept.  We just need to get a white 	paper to them to explain in detail.		Drilling -	The comment was the formations are tough but will get there slowly but surely.	Using 1 May as gas available at the plant date.		Change Orders -	Transmitted SCCs frustration on little movement on change orders related to 	the pipeline.  Told them that many of the change orders still without 	documents and in any case the strategy was to settle up at the end of the job.	Brad and Sue mentioned that they would feel more comfortable with the process 	and putting a number on the value of the change orders if we were closer to 	resolution.	worried about the size of the change orders - especially the outside case.	have not given this to the banks	there outside change order case is as follows -		    Power Plant  Pipeline  Total		Total EPC         US$ 419 mm	Approved Change Orders                    22 mm	Pending Change Orders  US$  10 mm  US$ 25 mm               35 mm	Cont Change Orders                8 mm            24 mm               32 mm		Hope this information is useful.		rgds		Laine

In attendance are Rob and 	John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 		getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 	Laine 	Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 	YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick	MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose	Current economics. - Rick		Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 	on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 	send the page per topic around by this friday.  		I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.		Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 	Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.		Pete

Mary 	has requested that we do the following:		1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 	summary.		2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.		3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 	calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.		4) Finalize sponsor support elements.		This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 	resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 	days to review the model and budget when submitted.		We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 	contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 	to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.

Mary 	has requested that we do the following:		1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 	summary.		2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.		3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 	calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.		4) Finalize sponsor support elements.		This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 	resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 	days to review the model and budget when submitted.		We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 	contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 	to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.

It came from 18.5% to 17.5% per	year level, setting downward bias until next meeting on July 18-19. This will 	at	least influence favorably the local markets, except foreign exchange in the	short run, boosting the mood of the society which may follow business leaders	who have already declared such one as a very positive move to the economic	growth side.		Assuming the move as first of others, despite not so large for the coming	months, consumers expectations may boost promoting additional economic growth 	in	the second semester. Argentina would eventually benefit in such scenario since	it may export more to Brazil, helping its difficult situation by generation of	additional reserves.		At this moment, what local players are trying to do is to understand the	rational of such move, which overcome the forecast of even the most optimistic	of the analysts.		The authority to justify the stronger move mentioned inflation forecasts	declining. The last inflation targeting report of the Central Bank shows a	forecast of 6.3% for the official index the IPCA in comparison with the	inflation-target of 6% for 2000 year. In fact, the new forecast in the market 	is	5.5% for 2000, in the best view. Additionally, the last inflation targeting	report shows a forecast of 3.3% against a target of 4% for 2001 year. However,	market argues that this do not justifies the intensity of the decline, 100 	basis	points against markets maximum expectation of a 50 bp reduction. So, there 	must	be other reasons to be understood.		We can list some other positive reasons. Fiscal primary surplus performance is	overcoming even the IMF goals. The cost of funding abroad is declining, as 	shown	by yesterday?s successful sovereign placement of an EUR 750 millions Eurobond 	to	yield 9.2%, comparably less than last September similar issue at 11.53%. We	could include the better mood on the US economic growth adjustment; Argentina	resistance to change the dollar pegged currency regime by new fiscal measures	and some better mood in the world growth as potential factors affecting	expectations. However, even all that does not justify the COPOM move for the	majority of local market makers. They agree in the direction of the move, but	not on the intensity and mainly not on the speed of the interest rates 	decline.		We can list two other potential reasons for such move. One is related to a	probable Standard & Poors upgrade on Brazil in the coming months, which may	eventually be followed by Moody`s later. The second is a political influence 	to	boost government?s popularity and I will risk saying even to make Finance	Minister Pedro Malan?s candidacy to the Presidency in 2002 feasible. On that	evaluation see the analisys of a political think tank based in Brasilia: 	?That?s	the most important political movement of the year. On political terms it 	became	clear a favourable economic scenario, rebounding President Cardoso popularity	and the chances of political victory increasing a lot, all that not ment<oning	that the political noise in Brasilia will diminish".

We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and 	would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me 	showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to 	hardware and business restrictions.		The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the 	days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of 	their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm 	on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for 	your staff!		The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test 	Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window, 	select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not 	work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says 	that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions 	where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for 	those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try 	to login some time Monday to insure they have access.		The test script during the time period will be:	12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports	12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing	12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in		Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very 	important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should 	pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks 	with poor system performance the better!

They have suggested 	the following instead:		1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 	summary.		2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.		3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 	calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.		4) Finalize sponsor support elements.		Theoretically the lenders can take 30 days to review the model and budget 	when submitted.		We will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.

This is especially 	noticeable when many paths are changed at once.  Even if it takes 1 - 2 	seconds to refresh a path, changing 20 - 30 paths could cause the other 	scheduler on that pipe to wait for 30 - 45 seconds.		We are developing a revised Auto Refresh option to let the scheduler pick 	whether they want Deal changes or Path changes (or both or neither).  To the 	scheduler, it will simply be a change on the Path Manager filter to replace 	the "Auto Refresh" checkbox with two checkboxes:	 - Auto Refresh Deals	 - Auto Refresh Paths	Once selected, this will be the default selection for the duration of that 	Path Manager session just as the current selection works.		This will have no impact on how or when the data is stored in Unify, only 	whether another PC should have its numbers updated.  Nominations will process 	all paths regardless of this new selection.		If our testing goes well, we may actually migrate this change to Unify 	Production tonight.  Please let me know if you know of any reason we should 	not go forward with this plan or have any questions or concerns.		Thanks, d.n.

The open issues relate to the following items in Attachment 8 which contains 	certain provisions to be used as part of the "Base Agreement:"		1.  The issue detailed in the attached of whether WestLB will indemnify GEII 	against actions of the Enron entity acting as "Agent."  Rob Gay is reviewing 	this issue.  This issue would impact Section 20.1(a).		2.  The inclusion of certain language that Enron has requested which would 	more clearly establish that GEII's indemnity obligation includes 	consequential damage claims by third parties.  The language at issue appears 	in Sections 20.1(b) and 27.2.		At Brett Wiggs' request, Cheryl Costa is discussing the above issues with 	GEII.

Date: Tue, 28 Mar 2000 17:36:15 -0500	From: "Vanessa Wilson" <VWILSON@skadden.com>	Cc: MTHURBER@skadden.com	Subject: GE Letter Agreement	Mime-Version: 1.0	Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="=_EEB7315F.5839C9D5"		Rob,		Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 	including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 	included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 	included in Attachment 8.		As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 	Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 	Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 	willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 	the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 	LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 	in the Purchase Agreement.		GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 	agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 	establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 	in the current draft of Attachment 8.		Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 	trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.

Article 20 regarding indemnification is 	included in Attachment 8.		As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 	Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 	Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 	willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 	the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 	LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 	in the Purchase Agreement.		GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 	agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 	establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 	in the current draft of Attachment 8.		Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 	trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.

Mary 	has requested that we do the following:		1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 	summary.		2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.		3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 	calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.		4) Finalize sponsor support elements.		This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 	resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 	days to review the model and budget when submitted.		We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 	contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 	to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.

Bu-bye		Rodney Dangerfield's Material...	 _______________________________________		 I was so poor growing up...If I wasn't born a boy.... I'd have nothing to	 play with.		 A girl phoned me the other day and said .... "Come on over, there's nobody	 home." I went over. Nobody was home.		 During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the other night	 she called me from a hotel.		 One day as I came home early from work ..... I saw a guy jogging naked. I	 said to the guy .... "Hey buddy, why are you doing that?" He said,	 "Because you came home early."		 Its been a rough day. I got up this morning ... put on a shirt and a	 button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm	 afraid	 to go to the bathroom.		 I was such an ugly kid........When I played in the sandbox the cat kept	 covering me up.		 I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a	 radio.		 I was such an ugly baby ... My mother never breast fed me. She told me	 that she only liked me as a friend.		 I'm so ugly ... My father carries around the picture of the kid who came	 with his wallet.		 When I was born .... the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my	 father "I'm very sorry.......We did everything we could......But he pulled	 through."		 I'm so ugly ... My mother had morning sickness.......AFTER I was born.		 I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to	 my father. He said he wanted more proof.		 Once when I was lost ..... I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find	 my parents. I said to him .... "Do you think we'll ever find them?" He said	 "I don't know kid ... there are so many places they can hide."		 My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.		 I'm so ugly ... I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd	 get.		 I went to see my doctor. "Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in	 the mirror, I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me?" He said "I	 don't know but your eyesight is perfect."		 I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My	 doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.

This would happen over 	and over again.  They said it was alright from 7:30 to 8:30 am, then became 	unusable about 8:30.  It has gotten to the point that on most days when they 	get cut off and they have to log back in they do not even consider this a 	problem.

That 	DASH states that Shell has not agreed to participate in the cost of the 	letter of credit and as a result that Enron is entitled to charge  Shell 	Libor plus 4 % per annum on Shell's share of the guarantee under the terms of 	a letter agreement between Shell Cuiaba Holdings Ltd. and Enron. 		Has this been put into effect?  We are sensitive to this because we may have 	IRS transfer pricing issues with respect to guarantees that Enron makes on 	loans to its various project entities.		The last time I had talked was to Joanna back in late September/October and 	she said it had not been put into effect.		Regards,		Rick

Claudia 	was very firm with him that there was nothing new and that he needed to go 	back through an old draft of the Consent to confirm that every item in the 	Aditivo used to be in the Consent.  They have an internal meeting scheduled 	today and the hope is that Laterman will have done this exercise and can 	confirm that there is nothing new (otherwise he will look foolish if we have 	to later correct him, which we can do by showing Celso et al an old draft of 	the consent).  However, Laterman also confirmed what Adelino appeared to be 	saying below:  that they intend to hold up the Aditivo in order to get their 	"clarifications" inserted -- i.e., the same old issue regarding sharing the 	spot price pain on F/M delay.		Separately, Claudia spoke with Maur?cio and he relayed some innocuous 	drafting comments.  He also said, however, that he and Maria Aparecida had 	prepared a memo to go to Firmino describing the open "commercial" points 	which had never been agreed.  He would not tell Claudia what these points 	were and said they were for Firmino to decide and not for the lawyers.  	Claudia was very firm in insisting that this memo describe every issue they 	think is still open in the documents so we don't end up resolving open items, 	as we are close to doing with respect to the big 4, only to find that he and 	Maria Aparecida have more comments.   Action item: Jim or Jo?o Carlos -- we 	need to hit Firmino on any "new" commercial issues asap -- there should be 	none.  He's supposed to have received the memo yesterday so a call today may 	be appropriate.		This is beginning to feel like Ground Hog Day all over again!

He asked me to contact 	Adelino Rodrigues. I was concerned that we would be going back to square one 	- No release until we agree to clarify their language.  Joao Carlos said "no 	negotiations", "just clarifications". I was still concerned, because I was 	told that the only new aspect was the Guarantee language for the 	privatization event and clause 9, the details/mechanics of the 90 days 	payments.		I finally got hold of Adelino around 11:00 am. I asked him if he had received 	the Aditivo #4, he said he had it. I asked him if he had any questions, he 	said he was reading it.  I pressed him to give me a response today, he said 	he was meeting with the Contract Committee (internal) tomorrow at 9:00 AM. I 	asked him to get together by noon- he said he needed to report any issues to 	the Diretoria. I ask him to meet at 2:00 PM and he agreed.		Adelino wanted to include other Contract Clarifications issues in this 	Aditivo #4. I told him that this was not the place. This Aditivo was to 	provide a faithful portrait of the results of discussion in regards to the 	Lenders issues. It was to mirror the key clauses the Covenant. And it was 	created at the direction of Eletrobras to provide a better legal foundation.		I told Adelino that we would be signing other Aditivos in the future  and it 	was our intend to clarify the items we included in the Transfer Agreement.		Adelino felt that there were other items not previously agreed in this 	Aditivo.		I called Claudia. She told me that she had met with Celso and Adelino and 	that this had come up and she had assured them that there was nothing extra 	that had not been agreed. She told me that Celso had not agreed. She was to 	speak to the Legal department in Furnas to be backed up.		She was walking into a Furnas meeting with Adelino.  I asked her to press 	this matter with Adelino and the legal department.		I saw the exchange of the e-mail with the Lenders. They are reacting with one 	day delay so I do not know if they are current in their comments. John and 	Rick let's have a quick talk early tomorrow. I will call you.		Jose

[Joao Carlos had 	just called Celso Ferreira to see if it was worthwhile to meet. But, Celso 	just wanted to rehash his position]		Adelino  told me that Celso Ferreira, his boss, surprised him with the news 	that at the Diretoria meeting the President had taken the view that he would 	not approve the Aditivo unless  we also negotiate the Penalty Clauses of the 	Contract to pick up (something??) of what they owe to the MAE.		I told him, that negotiation was not in the cards. To renegotiate this 	clause,  or to not apply the clause, would imply that the financial models, 	which was the basis of the Loan commitment, would change, thus we would be 	without financing. Under that scenario, to protect our position we would have 	no choice but to proceed with our Termination Notice.		He said he understood hat we needed to protect our position but that there 	was nothing he could do with those instruction.		I said , fine, but if we were to set that issue aside, what were the comments 	that he had in Aditivo #4, and the Termo de Consentimento? I was being 	advised that the current versions in total, are a faithful reflection of what 	had been discussed from the moment that we signed the document, the Transfer 	Agreement, transferring the Contract from Eletronorte to Furnas to the 	present. It was meant to capture the Lenders issues. What I wanted to know, 	was there something different in the text? Could he fax me a hand-written 	text of the portion that they disagreed?		He could not give me an answer. But he promised to send me something by 	Tuesday next week.		I told him that after I received it. I would consult with my people to find 	out why there is a difference and call him.			Actions. 		1) Legal team must be ready to proceed with the filing Dec 21 of our Notice 	of Termination. They need to analyze the Furnas response to the Default 	Notice. In the notification we can extend the time (if we want, beyond the 30 	days, we can use the feriados as a reason). Rick Lammers.  Let' s discuss 	next call.		2) We need to inform Aneel about it.  Cover letter explaing the situation 	,and key memos. 		3) Jim. We need to discuss how to use leverage on Luis Carlos Santos. If this 	goes to the ultimate, this will become an international incident; but, maybe 	he does not mind that.		We can contact the USA embassy, but I am not sure if people are gone for 	vacation.		4) Will need to review closely the Termination Scenario In January. We do not 	necessarily want to do it in January because of the status of the 	commissioning schedule. There are a number of regulatory issues to resolve.		Attached was my decriptions of the scenarios. 			Jose

I was aware of this, I'm just trying to 	figure out how to present this in a way that it does not invite much review 	or discussion.  It is one of the few elements which have to bridge the budget 	and the cash flow statement.  I am hopeful that the lenders will continue not 	to focus on it since there is no assurance that it will be received and more 	astute lenders would probably make us guarantee it.

We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 	220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)		2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 	time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 	transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 	describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 	detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 	long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 	corrective measures.]		3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 	220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 	dipatched above 220 MW.		If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 	are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 	is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 	Garvin flex months.		Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 	about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 	is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 	fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 	seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 	availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  	Any data you can provide will be helpful.			Have I successfully connected the dots here?		If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 	grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 	don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 	done.			Regards,		Rob

Thanks to the dedication and hard work of everyone, we were able to 	create a robust and compelling project in spite of numerous detractors and 	doubters.

Please note that we still have interests in Nigeria (notably an EPC contract 	for the Barges) and we remain engaged in a strategic alliance with AES and YF 	Power to ensure the successful evacuation of power to all Nigerians via the 	Barge project and the IPP as quickly as possible.  Notwithstanding this sale, 	we remain committed to this endeavor and believe that the alliance is the 	most expedient vehicle to the realization of everyone's goals.   If you 	happen to have discussions with outsiders regarding these projects, please do 	your part to quell the notion that Enron has "abandoned" the project.  Feel 	free to talk to me regarding any questions you may have.		Thanks again and congratulations on a job well done.		Keith

Although I think 	the people with the authority also ultimately have to accept the 	responsibility, I think Laine has done an incredible job on many fronts 	simultaneously (and I have said so to Mariella when queried).  However, maybe 	this thing is just bigger than all of us. I just don't know any more.   It's 	true there is a lot of pressure and I'm sure Laine is absorbing most of the 	blows.  I have taken a lot of heat from Global Finance and Kishkill myself.		It's true that over the last 6 months I have not always been able to pay 	attention to the flood of e-mails this project generates each day. However, 	as you know, my style is to focus on a task with great intensity so I usually 	find the e-mails relevant to the issue I have square in my sights.  It's also 	true that on a number of occaisions I have been inadvertantly left out of the 	loop (such apparently was the case here).  I think it is unreasonable to 	assume that I have seamless communication with Tracee and Felipe or that 	these two young associates can even discern everything that is important.  	They are really struggling with the complexity of this project, everything is 	new to them, and they don't have the benefit of experience to know what is 	normal.  As a result, increased patience and communication are in order.   		At this point I am trying to insure that the model we put in front of the 	lenders is credible and if we elect to present an undocumented issue in our 	favor than I want to be sure that I can defend the position.  I think we made 	great strides in toward developing a story which hangs together yesterday, 	although albeit in a painful fashion.  I want to reassure both you and Laine 	that I am committed to getting this done, I no longer have anything on my 	plate but this, and I am not going to break ranks when questioned by  the 	numerous folks nosing around.  The tough projects are what determine what we 	are made of.		I am comfortable with you forwarding these comments to Laine at your 	discretion.

We 	are both getting alot of heat from Corp right now for the overruns . I would 	not take it personal and I do not think he intended the remark towards the 	group on the phone but to others that he has talked to. His only comment to 	me after the call was that he felt he was sending you the info but that at 	times you had not had time to read it. I am not sure this is the case or if 	you even need to read all the notes that come to you but you may want to just 	ask Tracee to automatically forward you everything that you are not copied 	on. Overall- I would not dwell on it .We accomplished what we needed to on 	the call and at least from my point of view I can see that you are truly 	focused on pushing this thing across the goal line.Call me on my cell if you 	want to talk further.

We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 	220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)		2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 	time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 	transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring.

I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 	corrective measures.]		3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 	220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 	dipatched above 220 MW.		If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 	are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 	is ready by April 01.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 	about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 	is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 	fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 	seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 	availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.

Think there are different definitions of successful closure.   Financial 	close is key step -  gets Enron's money out, but does not improve the 	economics of the project.   I am looking to get as much of Enron's money out 	as possible and improve the economics of the remaining investment.		Cuiaba I is very much intertwined with the GTB/Transredes chain - also with 	Cuiaba II - restructuring of the project is complex - but we have pretty 	clear contractual rights to restructure the supply -  if the Furnas consent 	does not come - poker game becomes very high stakes during January -  and of 	course compounding all this is construction and budget and the mark to market 	position.		I would like to meet with Jose, John, Joao Carlos, Rick, Rob, Laine, 	Christiaan, and Felipe in Houston on the 8th, 9th and 10th (if needed) of 	January to go through this from top to bottom and figure out the game plan 	for how we are going to play these different opportunities off of one 	another. 		Please confirm your attendance -  		Joe/Orlando - if I am missing a key participant - please let me know.		Rob - can you get someone to make copy of the PPA, GSA, and Key financing 	documents for me to read.		Yvette - please get a large conference room for the three days.		Pete

We believe that EPE should not send the Notice of Intent to Terminate witho=	ut=20	extending either the cure or the consultation period, for the PPA and the=	=20	Brazilian legislation are not clear about the possibility of EPE to exercis=	e=20	its right to terminate the PPA after the 30-day consultation period.		Note that both solutions will only postpone the proceeding, for EPE will ha=	ve=20	to decide whether it intends to terminate the PPA or not.		On the other hand, we believe that there will be no termination process=20	without arbitration, as Furnas and Eletrobr?s have already denied the=20	occurrence of a "causa de inadimplemento" under the PPA.		Regarding the possibility for EPE to start the whole process again, based o=	n=20	the same "causa de inadimplemento", we believe that this proceeding would b=	e=20	very fragile and could be challenged by Furnas and Eletrobr?s. As a result,=	=20	we do not suggest you to adopt this alternative.		Finally, according to section 24 (XXII) of Federal Law No. 8,666/93, Furnas=	=20	may contract the supplying of electric energy without a previous bidding=20	process.

The PPA does not contain a provision stating the delay in enforcing a right	should not be deemed a waiver of that right.  But also, it does not require	that the notice of intent to terminate be served right after the 90-day	cure period.  Therefore, we can wait to send the actual notice of intent to	terminate.		A remark:  the cure period is of 90 days and not 120.  It expires in the	next couple of days if not already.  I am not sure what strength this	warning could have, maybe not much more than a threat.  I understand that	starting the termination process is a very serious step, with a lot of	implications, and I fully respect the decision of just sending the warning.	I would only ask whether this task would not be better achieved by informal	contacts rather than a formal letter.		A small correction:  notices may be served by courts or by notaries, but	that is not required by law unless in specific circumstances.  The PPA does	not provide for any formal notification procedure, and thus there would be	no need to do it by courts or notaries.		If you need to discuss any point on this document during Tuesday or	Wednesday, please look for Cl?udia Bonelli, as I will be out of town.

Item 3 is incorrect. The 300 MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at 	about 100 MW each and the remaining 100 MW coming from the steam turbine. The 	steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines 	and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output 	(theoretically at least, in practice depending on optimization of machines)		Again, please talk with Lucio.		Regards,		Christiaan				Rob G Gay@ENRON	12/18/2000 04:41 PM	To: Laine A Powell/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Christiaan 	Huizer/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Richard A Lammers/SA/Enron@Enron	cc: Tracee Bersani/HOU/ECT@ECT 	Subject: EPE Dispatch		Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:		1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 	meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 	margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 	220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)		2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 	time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 	transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 	describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 	detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 	long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 	corrective measures.]		3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 	220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 	dipatched above 220 MW.		If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 	are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 	is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 	Garvin flex months.		Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 	about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 	is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 	fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 	seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 	availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  	Any data you can provide will be helpful.			Have I successfully connected the dots here?		If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 	grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 	don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 	done.			Regards,		Rob

Last time when I talked to Blanca after the latest 	reorg, she said that it hadn't been announced how Southern Cone was going to 	be. How's it going now?		After nearly 3 years with Enron, I plan to go back to B school. I want to 	apply for Rice Executive MBA because this will be the most efficient way for 	me. Besides, I plan to apply two other full-time MBA programs. You have been 	my supervisor for one year. Although that was my first year with Enron, that 	assignment was quite important to me. I've learned a lot through that year 	and later I realize more and more the creativeness and greatness of the Debt 	Fund. The year with Debt Fund was an important phase of my professional 	history. May I ask you to be one of my evaluators? As you know, the 	competition for B school is always hard. A strong recommendation from you, a 	person in senior management will be crucial for my application. The deadline 	for Rice is Jan. 15. I'm sorry to give you such a short time. With the other 	two, I plan to finish them by the end of January or early Feburary. I 	appreciate it very much if you could spare me some time.		Thank you in advance for your generous help.

Tracee Bersani@ECT	01/05/2001 10:24 AM	To: Rob G Gay/NA/Enron@Enron	cc:  		Subject: Cuiaba: Release of certain Assets from Loan Pledge		Rob,		I just spoke with Rafael, and he has requested that certain assets be 	excluded from pledge items against the Cuiaba senior loans (EPE and GASMAT).		 All cars and vehicles;	 All furniture and IT equipment,	 All telephone lines 		(Please note that for EPE, the amounts related to those items is around 0.7% 	of the total permanent assets and for GASMAT is around 0.4%.)		 Inventories except spare parts ( 38% of the total inventories).  		(So, we should take out, fuel ( 55% of the total inventories), and  other 	items that are around 7% of the total inventories).			Regards,	Tracee

However, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as 	I understand it.  The lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically 	about third party liability meaning, I believe, lawsuits or claims from 	parties who did not receive power because Cuiaba failed to generate.  	Therefore, I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along 	the lines of:		1) If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl, What is the extent of 	damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements?		2) Could any consequential damages be assessed?		3) Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid 	documents, the PPA or other agreements with Furnas, Electronote or Eletrabras?		4) How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement 	which was payable by EPE?  Could the process be expedited to avert a 	liquidity crisis?		5) Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a 	spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage?  		6) Similarly, could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they 	failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of 	the agreements?		7) Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to 	back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under 	the PPA?		9) Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable 	by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability?		10) A question for insurance - Does our Business Interuption insurance 	protect us in any of these instances?  (Note: the US$20MM Sponsor liquidity 	facility provides some comfort to the lenders)			John, stop me if you think I am off track.  If you have other questions which 	you think need to be addressed please continue ....
