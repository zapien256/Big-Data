What are the map input key and value types?
    > type(input key) = String
    > type(value) = Number

What does the mapper do?

What are the map output key and value types? 

Can we use a combiner? 
    - Useful for computing word statistics

What does the reducer do? 
    - Calculate mean, variance

What are the reduce output key and value types? 
    - Text, WordStatisticsWritable

What are the file formats?
    -Text files

How to output multiple values per key?
    -use Text
        -- value is a string of C.S.V.s
        -- must convert our counts to strings, build the full string
        -- must parse the string on input (simple)

WordsStatisticsWritable:
    - Needs to implements the Writable interface
    - write() method will output the values needed for mean, variance
    - readFields() method will read the values needed for mean, variance

2 Different Approaches to WordStatisticsWritable:
    #1:
    - Include instance variables of type LongWritable and DoubleWritable
        -- Required Methods:
            - write(DataOutput out): 
                -- writes the instance variable values(call write())
            - ReadFields(DataInput in):
                -- Reads the instance variable values
                -- Create instances, call readFields()
    #2:
    - ArrayWritable (class provided by hadoop)
        -- Methods in addition to write() and readFields():
            - Writable[] get()
            - Class getValueClass()
            - void setWritable(Writable[] values)
            - Object toArray()
            - String[] toStrings()
